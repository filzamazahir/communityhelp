# Community Help
Community Help is built in Python using Pylot MVC. It uses Google Maps API, and lets a user pin locations of people in need, so that others may access this data based on a particular location when they wish to help someone out.

Pylot MVC is a lightweight MVC framework built in Python leveraging flask.

Source of Pylot MVC: https://github.com/Ketul-Patel/Pylot.git
